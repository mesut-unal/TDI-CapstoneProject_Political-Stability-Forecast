# TDI-CapstoneProject_Political-Stability-Forecast

This Capstone project* is a political forecasting study for educational purposes. It is a time series machine learning practice to predict political stabilities of each country by using some socio-economical indicators, e.g. urbanization, youth literacy etc. The data is obtained from the World Bank database (https://databank.worldbank.org/home.aspx) and ARIMA, mode specifically pmdarima libraries are used. Here is a screenshot of the interactive map:

### Next steps:
- Include more indicators for training and improve accuracy
- Publish the map on heroku


*This project is a graduation requirement for The Data Incubator Data Science Fellowship program.
